## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Hritick-kumar/Hritick-kumar** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a comprehensive sales data analysis project as part of my B.Tech CSE coursework, consolidating data from multiple sources to gain insights into sales performance.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced data analysis techniques and tools, including data preprocessing with pandas, data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and integrating large datasets for insightful analysis.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to data science and analytics, particularly those involving large datasets, data visualization, and machine learning applications.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding and implementing advanced data analysis methods and best practices for managing and interpreting large datasets.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about data analysis techniques, Python programming, or insights from my current sales data analysis project.

ğŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me at shivanshhritick@gmail.com.

âš¡ Fun fact: I once analyzed a dataset of historical weather patterns to predict the best days for outdoor activities, and my predictions were spot-on!
