# 📊 Sales Data Analysis Project

## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my **Sales Data Analysis** project! I'm currently in my 4th year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), and this project is a part of my coursework. Through this project, I’ve consolidated 3 years of sales data from 36 CSV files into a comprehensive sales fact table, complemented by 3 lookup tables for car models, sales representatives, and regions.

## 📋 Overview

This project focuses on integrating and analyzing sales data to uncover valuable insights. By processing and merging extensive datasets, I've built a unified sales fact table that enhances the depth of the analysis.

## 📊 Project Details

### Data Sources

- **Consolidated Data**: Combined sales data from 36 CSV files covering 3 years.
- **Lookup Tables**: Included 3 lookup tables for:
  - **Car Models** 🚗
  - **Sales Representatives** 🧑‍💼
  - **Regions** 🌍

### Data Processing

- **Preprocessing**: Utilized pandas for various preprocessing tasks, including:
  - **Cleaning**: Addressed data issues such as missing values and inconsistencies.
  - **Merging**: Integrated multiple datasets into a single sales fact table.
  - **Aggregation**: Aggregated data for insightful analysis.
- **Data Integration**: Combined the sales fact table with lookup tables for enriched data context.

### Key Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing with pandas**: Cleaning, merging, and aggregating data for analysis.
- **Data Integration**: Merging fact tables with lookup tables to provide comprehensive insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 📚
